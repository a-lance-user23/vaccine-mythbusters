                    <p>
                        Vaccines will not make you sick.Some people can experience mild side effects from some vaccines, such as soreness 
                        at the injection site or a low-grade fever, but they dissipate quickly.
                        According to WHO, serious side effects from vaccines rarely occur. In fact,
                         many  adverse effects are so rare that their risk cannot be accurately assessed statistically.

                    <li>Myth 2:Vaccines have toxic materials in them</li>
                    <p>     
                        Dosage is everything when it comes to toxicity.
                        Any substance—even water—can be toxic in large doses. Some vaccines contain ingredients like formaldehyde and aluminum, but these trace amounts are so small that they're not considered toxic or harmful.
                        The gelatin and egg proteins featured in some flu vaccines can cause allergic reactions in very rare cases. Those affected typically have a history of severe allergies to gelatin or eggs. If you have an allergy to any of the ingredients in the vaccine, talk to your doctor or the person administering your vaccine.
