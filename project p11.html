                Vaccinemythbusters is a website that will be 
                dedicated to debunking false claims about the covid vaccine and 
                encouraging people to take them. I will be sourcing the myths 
                from friends and social media to find the most widespread and 
                harmful misconceptions and deal with them. The last page of the 
                website will be used to show the references for the information 
                that was gathered and used in the debunking process. I also plan 
                to share information on the virus and the danger that vaccine 
                hesitancy could cause in the future.
