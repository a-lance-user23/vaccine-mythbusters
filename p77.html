                  Myth 6: Vaccines cause variants
               </h1>
               <p>
                  Vaccines do not cause variants this myth came around because of the new variants that came around along with the increase in the vaccination efforts this is a quite funny myth because it is the opposite of the truth in fact vaccinations can stop the formation of new variants because it gives the virus less chances to mutate which then leads to less variants
